  <h2>History of N64</h2>
  
  <div class="history">

    <p>When it hit store shelves back in 1996, the Nintendo 64 rolled out with a Big Bang-like explosion in the form of Super Mario 64 and ended its life in a morass of increasing irrelevance for Nintendo and the rise of the PlayStation 2 as the dominant video game system on the market. How did a company that ruled the home console market during the Famicom and Super Famicom era lose its way with its first 3D-capable system?</p>
  
    <p>Some people credit the “advanced” system’s cartridges with hindering its capacity and thus the creativity developers could put into games. This, in turn, contributed to the less-than-robust support from those same third-party developers who moved en masse to the PlayStation, which was both easier to develop for and provided a cheaper way to manufacture games by putting them in a disc format.</p>
  
    <p>Touted as Project Reality and shown off in Killer Instinct arcade cabinets, the future Nintendo 64 promised to be cutting-edge and high-end tech from one of gaming’s most beloved companies. And while Super Mario 64 wowed and other games like Golden Eye helped kick off the modern multiplayer experience as we know it, the Nintendo 64 is still not as monumental a system in the history of gaming as the PlayStation. </p>
